# Grammar game : The integretion of RECIPE's intrinsic motivation framework for gamification technique
# NSC - TICTA Project
## Abstract
English skills are crucial for knowledge seeking and communication. Most knowledge is recorded in English, but Thai students often struggle due to limited English proficiency. This poses a significant obstacle to accessing a wide range of information.
The OBEC has launched a basic English program to improve students' speaking and writing skills. However, traditional teaching methods haven't been very effective, and Thailand's average English proficiency remains low compared to other countries.
Student motivation is key to effective learning. When students are motivated, they pay closer attention to the subject matter. Gamification is a new technique that has been shown to boost student engagement and motivation. However, many gamified interventions only provide extrinsic motivation, such as leaderboards, points, badges, or rankings. This can lead to initial interest but often results in decreased engagement over time.
The key is to foster intrinsic motivation, which helps students understand the value of learning English and develop their own desire to improve. The RECIPE gamification framework is a novel approach that can increase student intrinsic motivation, leading to long-term learning and a lifelong love of learning. This project aims to develop a game that motivates learners intrinsically, helping them develop their English skills by implementing the RECIPE framework as the core principle of game design and development.
