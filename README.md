# NSC - TICTA Project
## Abstract
English skills are crucials for knowlegde seeking and communication. Most of the knowledge are recorded in English. But Thai are poor of English skills being the big obstruction to doing wide range of information. even though the OBEC have been lunching basic English program ensure student speaking and writing but their teaching method are not effective, Thai average English proficient ranked at last row among all countries in the world in 2023. The main reason that make student engage in learning is motivation whether from internal and external, student significantly pays more attention to the subjects if the are motivated. Gamification is the novel techniques to boost student engagement and motivation. As this technique wild spread, but only a few of them success in boosting student long-term motivation which is important for student to learn as the English skills need retention and continuously learning. Most of the student having less motivation as the gamification intervention goes. The problem is most of the gamification intervention provide only student external motivation such as leaderboard, point, badge, or ranking which make student interest at first but decreasing engagement level after a few month. The key of this problem is to provide intrinsic motivation make student know why they have to engage, and have their own wills to learn. RECIPE gamification framework is a novel approach to increase student intrinsic motivation. which lead to long term learning and long life learning. The adaptation of this framework not very be present as much so in this project we would develop game that cause learners intrinsic motivation, help to motivated learners, and can boost student English skills. by implementing RECIPE framework to be the based principle of game design and development.
